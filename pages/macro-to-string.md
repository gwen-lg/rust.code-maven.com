Sometimes I get tired typing in `to_string`, especially in test cases so I wrote this macro.

![](examples/macro-to-string/src/main.rs)

I am a bit ambivalent as I don't like one-letter variables or functions name, but I want this to be short.

An besides I can search for `s!` if I am looking for all the uses.
