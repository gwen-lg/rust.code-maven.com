A few links I used as the background in my presentation in the [Rust TLV](https://www.meetup.com/rust-tlv/) meetup group at [Final](https://www.final.co.il/).

* Home page of [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab)

* [rustatic](https://rustatic.code-maven.com/), my first [Crate](https://crates.io/)
* [Rust Digger](https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/), the project analyzing [Crates](https://crates.io/), collecting "common practices" and suggesting improvements.
* [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/), the blog where I write about Rust.
