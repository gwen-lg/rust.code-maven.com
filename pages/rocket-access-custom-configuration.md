The [Rocket web framework](/rocket) configuration system allows you to override the default values and provide additional keys and values in the `Rocket.toml` file located in the root directory
of the project.

There is a whole page about [Rocket configuration](https://rocket.rs/v0.5/guide/configuration/), but to tell the truth I could not fully understand it. So maybe what I am showing here is, well
suboptimal.

In this example we'll see how we can access the configuration values in the routes.

## Dependencies

![](examples/rocket/configuration/Cargo.toml)

## The Rocket.toml configuration file

![](examples/rocket/configuration/Rocket.toml)


## Logging the configuration value

In this example we use the [logging facility of Rocket](/rocket-logging) we have already seen.


Get the `profile` field of the configuration. This will be `debug` when we run `cargo run` (or cargo test) and it should be `release` when we run `cargo run --release` or `cargo test --release`.
We compare it to the `debug` string, so this should print `true` in debug mode and `false` in release mode. This is how we can check in a given field contains a specific value we are expecting.

```rust
rocket::info!("profile is debug: {:?}", rocket::Config::default().profile == "debug");
```

## Custom configuration fields

Beside the configuration fields that Rocket defined we can add our own fields to `Rocket.toml` and we can access them in the routes:

In the first example we define the type on the variable (and hence we really need a variable here). We also used `unwrap_or` to set a default value in case the field
is not in `Rocket.toml`. There are several other [unwrap-like methods](/unwrap-or) for other ways to handle this situation.

```rust
let custom_a: String = rocket::Config::figment().extract_inner("custom_a").unwrap_or(String::from("some default"));
rocket::info!("home {:?}", custom_a);
```

In this example we used the [Turbofish](/turbofish) syntax to tell Rust what is the expected type of the field.
As we did add this field to the `Rocket.toml` you will see that the value we get is the "some default".

```rust
let custom_b = rocket::Config::figment().extract_inner::<String>("custom_b").unwrap_or(String::from("some default"));
rocket::info!("home {:?}", custom_b);
```

Finally I just wanted to see all the configuration fields in one blob:

```rust
rocket::info!("default: {:#?}", rocket::Config::default());
```

## Running the app seeing the logs

We can now run the app using

```
cargo run
```

or

```
cargo run --release
```

and as we access `http://localhost:8000/` we can see the log messages on the console where we executed the `cargo run ...` command.


## Running the test seeing the logs

We don't even need to run the app to see the log messages. We can see them while running the tests.

By default if we run `cargo test` it will hide the log messages generated by Rocket. We can pass the `--nocapture` flag and then it will print all the logs as
it was discussed when we wanted to know [how to show the standard output and standard error in tests in Rust](/show-output-in-tests).

```
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

It is very colorful, but we are interested only what we printed.

The first 3 lines correspond to the first 3 calls to `log::info!`
The first part of this whole output is the cull configurations this corresponds to our first call of `log::info!`.
