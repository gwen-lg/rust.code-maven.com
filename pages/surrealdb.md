[SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) is feature-rich database written in Rust.

I've started to explore it and this page is going to be used as a starting point and a collection of the articles I publish on how to use SurrealDB in applications written in Rust.

You might also want to consult the [Awesome SurrealDB](https://github.com/surrealdb/awesome-surreal) a curated list of SurrealDB resources, tools, utilities, and applications.
