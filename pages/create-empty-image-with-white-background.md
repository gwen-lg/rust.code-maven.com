When we create an image the default color of each pixel is black as you can see in the [empty image example](/create-empty-image).
In this example we just set all the pixels to be white. We could of course set them to any color we would like expressed in RGB - red-green-blue triplets.

After setting all the pixel to white I realized that you won't be able to see the white image on the white background of this page, so I also added two
more loops to set the borders of the image to black.
