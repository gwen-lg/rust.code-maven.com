Hi,


## Articles

There are several new articles again since my previous message. A few I'd like to emphasize:

* [Change a single character in a string in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/change-a-single-character-in-a-string)
* [Pass a mutable vector to a function in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/pass-mutable-vector-to-function)
* [Evolution of error handling in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/evolution-of-error-handling)

## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
