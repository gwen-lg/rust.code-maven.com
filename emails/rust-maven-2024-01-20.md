Hi,

## Articles

Both Perl and Python have excellent linters that can be installed. In Rust it comes with the compiler and it is called Clippy.
I think I should create a whole section about it, but for now you can use the [Clippy](https://rust.code-maven.com/tags/clippy) tag.

* [Simple case of using the clippy::pedantic lints and setting priority](https://rust.code-maven.com/simple-case-of-pedantic-lints)
* [Automatically fixing issues in Rust code](https://rust.code-maven.com/automatically-fixing-issues-in-rust)
* [Rocket - logging in the web application](https://rust.code-maven.com/rocket-logging)
* [Testing with tempfiles and environment variables](https://rust.code-maven.com/testing-with-environment-variables)

## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
