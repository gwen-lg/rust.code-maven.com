Hi,

to tell the truth I have been feeling very unproductive lately. That's why I have not sent any email for more than a week.
Looking back I see I had a 3-day period when I could not publish anything, but I also see I wrote quite a few articles during this week.

Let me list them here to make it easier for you to pick the ones that might be interesting to you:

## Articles

* [Rocket - multi-counter using cookies](https://rust.code-maven.com/rocket-multi-counter-using-cookies)
* [Rocket - multi counter using encrypted cookies](https://rust.code-maven.com/rocket-multi-counter-using-encrypted-cookies)
* 4 articles about [SurrealDB](https://rust.code-maven.com/surrealdb).
* [Split code into multiple Rust files](https://rust.code-maven.com/split-code-into-multiple-files)
* [Clap - subcommands for command line applications in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/clap-subcommand)
* [Simple CLI menu in the terminal](https://rust.code-maven.com/simple-cli-menu)
* [Macro to_string](https://rust.code-maven.com/macro-to-string)
* [unwrap, unwrap_or, unwrap_or_default, unwrap_or_else](https://rust.code-maven.com/unwrap-or)
* [Getting started with Clippy on an existing project](https://rust.code-maven.com/getting-started-with-clippy-on-an-existing-project)

## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
