Hi,

## Twitter

My strategy works. My Twitter followers tripled overnight. Now there are 3. :-)

Follow me here: [RustMaven](https://twitter.com/RustMaven) and.

## Articles

* [3 ways to handle number overflow or underflow in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/how-to-handle-overflow).
* [unwrap, one way to handle errors in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/unwrap).
* but maybe it is better to [avoid unwrap](https://rust.code-maven.com/avoid-unwrap).
* First [Implement the reverse trait for strings](https://rust.code-maven.com/reverse-trait-for-strings)
* then [separate it to its own crate](https://rust.code-maven.com/reverse-trait-for-strings-in-a-crate) to make it reusable.


## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!
