Hi,

I just realized I have not sent any updates for almost 2 months. It's not that I have not written anything, it is just ...
(insert excuse).

Sorry for that.

I'd recommend you visit the [archive](https://rust.code-maven.com/archive) to see what new thing is there that might be interesting to you.

I also just realized there are now **150 articles** in the archive.

## Articles

A few I'd emphasize:

* I posted quite a few in the [Rocket](https://rust.code-maven.com/rocket) series about web development.
* [Strings and memory allocation in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/strings-and-memory-allocation)
* Some stats about [Rust and other languages on GitHub](https://rust.code-maven.com/rust-vs-other-languages-on-github)


## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
