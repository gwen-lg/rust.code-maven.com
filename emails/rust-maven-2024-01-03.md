Hi,

## Articles

I published 3 articles about the [Rouille](https://rust.code-maven.com/rouille) web framework. It seems to be very simple, but I could not find a built-in way to test it
so I put it aside.

Then I went back experimenting with the [Rocket web framework](https://rust.code-maven.com/rocket). It seems a lot more complex and it's web site has issues (but it has a web site!). However, after spending a few hours reading the docs and experimenting with it I start to like it. There are now 4 articles about it and I am working on more.


## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
