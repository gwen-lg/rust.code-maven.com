Hi,

## Articles

* It is still not "natural" for me how I need to indicates error conditions in Rust so I created a simple example to get started: [Indicating error, returning Result of Ok or Err in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/returning-result-string).
* I am working on another small command line tool that generates HTML files. I wanted to embed the version number of the code in the HTML and for that I wanted to [embed the version number in the binary compiled by Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/embed-version-number-in-the-code).

* Finally, there is a draft I am still working on it. The idea is to collect the companies that use Rust and for which there is some publicly available evidence in the form of a blog post, youtube video, podcast etc. [companies](https://rust.code-maven.com/companies). It will be an ongoing project, and I'd like to publish the article only once it has a bit more content and looks nicer. Do you have any suggestion for this post?


## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!
