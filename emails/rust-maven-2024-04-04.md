Hi,

* I saw the results of the 2023 Rust survey. This question was especially interesting to me: [In which technology domains is Rust used? - Rust survey 2023](https://rust.code-maven.com/technology-domains-2023). So I extracted the data.

## Articles

There are several new articles again since my previous message. A few I'd like to emphasize:

* [Count distribution of values - how many times each word appears in a list of words](https://rust.code-maven.com/count-distribution-of-values)
* [Memory allocation and usage in Rust ](https://rust.code-maven.com/memory-allocation-and-usage)
* [Press ENTER to continue](https://rust.code-maven.com/press-enter-to-continue)

## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
