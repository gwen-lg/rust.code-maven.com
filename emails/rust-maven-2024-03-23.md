Hi,

## Videos

I've recorded my first Rust-related video in English: [Strings and memory reallocation in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqVgTafRCCU).
Don't forget to "like" the video, to subscribe to the channel and click on the bell to get notifications when I upload a new video!


## Articles

* [Reuse macro in the same Rust crate across several files](https://rust.code-maven.com/reuse-macro-in-the-same-crate) is just a helper article.

* Several more entries were added to the list of [companies using Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/companies).


## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
