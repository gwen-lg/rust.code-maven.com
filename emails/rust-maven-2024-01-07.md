Hi,

## Twitter

As an experiment I've started to use post content on Twitter using the [RustMaven](https://twitter.com/RustMaven) username.
If you are on Twitter, please follow me and help me get some traction by likeing some of my posts.

Even if you don't usually use Twitter, but if you have an account I'd appreciate a little push.

## Articles

I guess I was not very productive in the last 2 days. I only have this for now:

* [Rocket - Single counter in a plain text file](https://rust.code-maven.com/rocket-single-counter-in-text-file)

## Source

May I just remind you that the whole site is in [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.code-maven.com/).
If you have any suggestions for improvements that can be an excellent place.


## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
