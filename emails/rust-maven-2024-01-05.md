Hi,

I started to develop a web-based platform to help people organize meetings. I would call them meet-ups, but a company might get upset that I use an English word that they used as the name of their company.

So I'll called the site [Meet-OS](https://meet-os.com/).

I've started to write in a couple of days ago and got to the point where I could already announce the first event about [Web development with Rocket](https://meet-os.com/event/1).
The site still does not have a registration system, but you can already follow [this issue](https://github.com/szabgab/meetings.rs/issues/3) to get notified as I make progress with it.

I hope within a few days I'll be able to make it work.

Your encouragement would help.

## Articles

We had a little celebration [ðŸŽ‚ The first 100 articles on Rust Maven ðŸ¦€](https://szabgab.com/rust-maven-100).

There are a few smaller articles now:

* [Remove whitespace: trim, strip in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/remove-whitespace)
* [Email address validation in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/email-address-validation)
* [Generate uuid, a Universally unique identifier in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/generate-uuid)

I also created two new topic-pages:

* [Testing in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/testing)
* [CLI](https://rust.code-maven.com/cli)

I hope these will help organize the site better.

## Source

May I just remind you that the whole site is in [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.code-maven.com/).
If you have any suggestions for improvements that can be an excellent place.


## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
