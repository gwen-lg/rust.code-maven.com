[Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/), the author of the Rust Maven web site maintains several [Open source projects in Rust](/projects)
and while he still feels he has tons of new things to learn about Rust he already offers [training courses in Rust](/training-course)
and still teaches Python, Perl, git, GitHub, GitLab, CI, and testing.
