      description: "Faster code, reduced memory footprint, a lot less CPU usage. Pros: Low memory usage; Awesome performance; Solid toolchain; Friendly error messages. Cons: Lifetimes are confusing (partially solved since then); Errors are hard to debug (several solutions were created since then); Many libraries are still early (libraries are way more mature since then); Asynchronous Rust is difficult (this has improved a lot since then)."
